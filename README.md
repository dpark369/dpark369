# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Park

## About Me
I was a chemical engineering student in University of Illinois. After achieving my goal of attending a good school, I was lost, without a goal, not knowing what I truly wanted to do. So I went to fulfill my military duty in Korea to buy myself some time. I was still without a goal after 2 years of service, but soon after I went through some CS lectures on Youtube and quickly fell in love. After countless courses and projects, Iâ€™m proud to say Iâ€™m a developer.As a selfâ€‘taught web developer, I am an expert at googling and looking through the documentations. I am a great adapter that is ready to learn and use any stack needed. I currently have experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, React, Git, Node.js, Express, EJS, Mongo DB, SQL and Bootstrap. However, I am growing as a web developer every day and plan on learning more skills.
